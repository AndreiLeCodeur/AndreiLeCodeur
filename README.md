## About Me

  Hello! I'm an engineering student based in France with a passion for coding. Currently, I'm gaining valuable experience through my own projects and uni.
  
## Interests

  - **Coding**: I enjoy exploring different programming languages and working on various projects.
  - **Video Games**: La lu li le lo
  - **Music**: I play a lot of guitar and listen to rock music.

## Experience

  I am very interested in data science (it's my field of study so I better do ...). I developed my own Neural network library from scratch and work constantly to improve it. 
  I do various random projects like a recursive compiler for brainfuck or other little projects.
